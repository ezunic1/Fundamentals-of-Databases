This repository provides SQL code for various queries related to Oracle's HR demo schema. These exercises are part of my coursework for the Database Fundamentals course at my university. The queries demonstrate different database operations, exploring interactions within tables and relationships in a human resources management setting. An ER diagram for the schema is also included for reference.
